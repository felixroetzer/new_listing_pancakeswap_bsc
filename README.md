# New Listings on Pancakeswap Binance Smart Chain

This repository hosts a Python-based tool designed to track new listings for Binance Smart Chain tokens on Pancakeswap.

For access to the Binance Mainnet, it is required to enter a Websocket URI from Quicknode or another provider for the BSC Eventlog Websocket. This can easily be found on Quicknode after creating an account. The URI has to be inserted into the 'quicknode_uri' variable in the run function.
